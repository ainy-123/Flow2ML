## Introduction 
<p>Write only a Few Lines of
Machine learning code using
Flow2Ml</p>
 
<p>Quickly design and customize pre-processing workflow in machine learning.
Obtain training, validating samples with only 3 lines of code using Flow2ML toolkit

Check Installation and sample code to flow into your ML model much faster and efficiently.</p>
 
## Why Flow2ML
<p>Flow2ML is an open-source library to make the machine learning process much simpler. It loads the image data and applies the given filters and returns train data, train labels, validation data, and validation labels.
For all these steps it just takes 3 lines of code. It mostly helps beginners in the field of machine learning and deep learning where the user would deal with image-related data.</p>


## Programming languages and technologies used:
1. Python
2. HTML
3. Numpy library
4. OpenCV
5. Machine Learning

## Download all Dependencies by :
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
	
## Getting Started 

Flow2ML for Python can be installed from Source,Pypi and Docker container installation methods.

   ## From Source

   $ git clone https://github.com/flow2ml/Flow2ML.git <br />
   $ cd flow2ML <br />

   Or using PIP:

   $ git clone https://github.com/flow2ml/Flow2ML.git <br />
   $ cd flow2ML <br /
   $ pip install . <br />
   
   ## From Pypi
   $ pip install flow2ml <br />
   
   ## From Docker Image / Container
   Clone this repo and cd into it: <br />
   $ git clone https://github.com/flow2ml/Flow2ML.git <br />
   $ cd flow2ML <br /

   Build the docker image: <br />
   $ docker build -t flow2ml . <br />

   Now you can run any of the code in this directory:

   Run the container,  and specifying which code to run. <br />
   -v : The volume on which repo code is mounted <br />
   Replace "script.py" with the name of your code you'd like to run <br />
   Replace "pwd" with the path of the example file you'd like to run. <br />

   $ docker run -it --rm \ -v $(pwd)/:/root/flow2ml/ python script.py

## Sample Code
```py
    # To be given input by the user.
    img_dimensions = (150,150,3)
    # If working with greyscale image, change the number of channels from 3 to 1.
    test_val_split = 0.1

    # Import flow2ml package
    from flow2ml import Flow

    # Give the Dataset and Data directories
    flow = Flow( 'dataset_dir' , 'data_dir' )

    # Define The Filters to be used
    filters = ["median", "laplacian", "gaussian", "sobelx", "sobely","bilateral"]

    # Apply The Filters
    flow.applyFilters( filters )

    # Define The augmentation operations to be used
   
    operations = {'flip': 'horizontal', 'rotate': 90, 'shear': {'x_axis': 5, 'y_axis': 15}, 'crop': [50, 100, 50, 100], 'scale': 0.1, 'zoom': 2, 'Hist_Equal':False, 'greyscale': True, 'CLAHE':False, 'invert':False, 'erode':False, 'dilate':False, 'open':False, 'close':False,'threshold':{'type':'adaptive','thresh_val':0},'color-space':{'input':'BGR','output':'BGR'}}

    # Apply The Augmentation
    flow.applyAugmentation( operations )

    # Obtain Train, Validation data splits
    (train_x, train_y, val_x, val_y) = flow.getDataset( img_dimensions, test_val_split )

    #Define The algorithms to be used

    algorithms = {'logistic_regression':{'metrics':None, 'activation_function':None}}

    # Apply training models
    flow.applyModels ( algorithms )

    from flow2ml import Auto_Results
    
    # Set the Input Model by replacing None
    model = None
    x = Auto_Results(model,val_x,val_y)
    # Call the get_results_docx() function to get the results in a Results folder 
    x.get_results_docx()

    #for tensorflow users 
    from flow2ml import Tf_Results

    model = None
    x = Tf_Results(model,validation_generator)
    x.tf_get_results_docx() 
```

Please try to maintain the dataset in the following manner in order to run the code easily.
```text

dataset_dir
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄdata_dir/
|       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄLabel 1 Folder
|       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄLabel 2 Folder
|       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄLabel 3 Folder  
|               .
|               .
|               .        
|       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄLabel n Folder 
| 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄOther Files

```
